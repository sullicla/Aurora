						The first step in the process is capturing the data on your phone. This could be anything from
						sending a text message, making a phone call, or browsing the internet. When you perform any of
						these actions on your phone, your device collects the information and prepares it to be sent
						over a network.

				<div class="timeline__event__description">
					<p>Once your phone has collected the data, it needs to send it over a network.
						This is where your cellular or Wi-Fi connection comes into play. When you send a message or make
						a call, your phone uses a wireless signal to send the data to the nearest cell tower or Wi-Fi
						router.
						From there, the data is sent over a series of interconnected networks until it reaches its
						destination.</p>

					<p>As the data travels over the network, it needs to be routed to the correct destination, which in

						This is done through a process called packet switching, where the data is broken down into
						smaller packets and sent through different routes to ensure it gets to its destination as
						quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
